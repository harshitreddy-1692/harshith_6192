# **📌 Abstract**

The *Fleet Management System* is a console-based C program designed to manage and maintain records of vehicles within a fleet. It allows the user to add vehicle details, display all stored vehicles, search for a vehicle by its ID, and update the mileage of a selected vehicle. The system uses an array of structures for data storage, ensuring efficient organization of multiple vehicle attributes such as ID, model, type, and mileage. This project helps users understand structure-based data handling, menu-driven programming, iterative control flow, and basic CRUD operations in C.
